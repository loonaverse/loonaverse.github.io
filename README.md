# LOOΠΔVERSE
(loonaverse.github.io)

## What is this?
It is a website that keeps track of LOOΠΔ posts and media online. Think of it as a collector that presents you with all sorts of information regarding LOOΠΔ.

## What is LOOΠΔ?
LOOΠΔ is South Korean Girl Group consisting of 12 members under the label Blockberry Creative.

## What does the website contain at the moment?
As of writing this, I have covered up a lot of LOOΠΔ TV episodes from the past 1.5 years. This website is not complete as I am still quite new to web development. I am using this in order to learn web development languages.

## Forking:
Would you like to support this project? Let me know about the fork and give me credits :'D plis. Thank!


The updates will be slow for a while. 

...
I have nothing else to write at the moment...
