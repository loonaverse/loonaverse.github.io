# LOOΠΔVERSE

(loonaverse.github.io)

## What is this?

It is a website that keeps track of LOOΠΔ posts and media online. Think of it as a collector that presents you with all sorts of information regarding LOOΠΔ.

## What is LOOΠΔ?

LOOΠΔ is South Korean Girl Group consisting of 12 members under the label Blockberry Creative.

## What does the website contain at the moment?

As of this writing, I have covered up a lot of LOOΠΔ TV episodes from the past 2 years. This website is not complete as I am still quite new to web development. I am using this in order to learn web development languages.

The updates will be slow for a while.

P.S: Currently best viewed on Desktop.
